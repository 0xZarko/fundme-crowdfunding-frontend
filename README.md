# Testing Crowdfunding Project - Frontend

This is a super basic frontend for the hardhat-crowdfunding repo, using only HTML and Javascript.

You should have a Hardhat node running and a Metamask wallet with at least some of the Hardhat wallets imported (Recommended: import your deployer wallet so you can test Withdraw functionality).

You might have to change the contractAddress constant in constants.js if your FundMe contract was deployed at another address when spinning up your local Hardhat node.

Tested using the "Live Server" extension from VS Code, formatted using Prettier.
